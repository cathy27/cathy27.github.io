It seems that I'm not alone to believe that git commands are poorly designed.[^1]

To make things worse, they also provide a human-unreadable documentation as well.[^2]
So it's very common for beginners to leave a mess in the workspace after running a God-knows-what-it-means git command. Therefore I wrote this blog. Hopefully this could save you from clueless.

## The Cheat Sheet

Some commonly used git commands are listed below, along with the corresponding commands to undo or fixup the mess.

|   **Git Command**   |           **How To Undo**           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `git add <file>...` | `git rm --cached <file>...`         |
| `git commit`        | `git reset HEAD^ --soft`            |
| `git commit`        | `git revert <commit_sha>`           |
| `git merge`         | `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD`        |
| `git pull`          | `git reset HEAD@{1}`                |
| `git push`          | `git push --force origin <refspec>` |

## Remarks

- 本来用英文就是随便写写，后来发现ghost-blog的英文字体渲染真的好漂亮。于是决定以后都用英文写了吧（误。。）
